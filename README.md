# JavaC8
A Java CHIP-8 Emulator focusing on fixing quirks from my old project. My old emulator didn't focus on a lot of CHIP-8's quirks and ran a very few selections of programs. This new emulator should suffice those problems for now.

## This emulator wouldn't be possible without the help from
* [Timendus CHIP-8 Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite): A amazing resource for anyone trying to make a reliable CHIP-8 Emulator.
* [Tobias V. Langhoff guide to make a CHIP-8 emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/): A very easy to understand guide to entering the world of emulation development.
